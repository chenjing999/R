### Arithmetic with R

R can be used as a calculator. You can use +to add numbers. 

You can use - to subtract numbers. 

To multiply numbers together, use *. 

Divide two numbers with /. 

Parentheses can be used to prioritize calculations. 

In R, ^ is the exponentiation operator. It raises the number on its left to the power of the number on its right. 

The modulo operator %% returns the remainder of the division of the number on its left by the number on its right. 


### LIKE keyword & wildcards

The LIKE keyword can be used in a WHERE clause to compare against a string pattern. 

The % wildcard acts as a placeholder for other values and matches 0, 1, or many characters. 

You can use the 'A%' string pattern to look for values that start with the capital letter 'A'. 

The NOT LIKE keyword returns records that do not match a pattern. Using NOT LIKE 'A%' will return all values that do not start with an 'A'. 

The _ wildcard matches a single character. Specifying the string pattern '_n%' after LIKE will return values that have 'n' as the second character and one character in front of 'n'.
